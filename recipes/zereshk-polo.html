        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>Zereshk Polo ba Morgh is a Persian classic made with Zereshk (barberries), 
        Morgh (chicken), and Polo, which is the steamed and fluffy Persian rice. 
        This is one of the mixed rice dishes that you will find at small casual get 
        togethers, as well as larger Persian dinner parties, weddings and most festive 
        celebrations and holidays. Sometimes this dish is served side by side with a 
        type of soup, usually Soup é Morgh é Zaferani, or Soup é Jo and a simple salad.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul><strong>For the chicken:</strong>
            <li>8 skinless chicken thighs, or drumsticks (about 3 pounds)</li>
            <li>1 tsp turmeric</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>3/4 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>1 large onion cut in half</li>
            <li>3 cups water</li>
            <li>1/8 tsp ground saffron powder (optional)</li>
            <li>1 medium yellow onion, sliced thin and fried to golden brown in 2 tbsp 
                vegetable oil (or 3 ounces fried onions)</li>
            <li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 tbsp fresh squeezed lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 tbsp zereshk (pick through, wash and rinse)</li>
            <strong>For the Zereshk Polo:</strong>
            <li>2 1/2 cups uncooked basmati rice</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp rice spice, divided</li>
            <li>1 large onion diced medium and fried to golden brown in 3 tbsp ghee, or butter</li>
            <li>1/3 cup zereshk, (pick through, wash and rinse)</li>
            <li>pinch of ground saffron powder (optional)</li>
            <li>Sliced almonds and/or pistachios (optional garnish)</li>
           
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>In a large 12-inch skillet (with a lid) add the chicken thighs
                (bone side down), turmeric, salt, pepper, onion halves and 3 cups
                of cold water. Without covering the skillet, bring it to a boil
                over medium high so all the foam from cooking the raw chicken rises 
                to the top. Use a slotted spoon to skim off the foam. Reduce the heat 
                to medium low, cover the skillet and cook for 30 minutes, then turn 
                the chicken pieces and cook for another 30 minutes on medium low.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Thirty minutes into cooking the chicken,</strong> start making the rice 
                according to the instructions for Aromatic rice.
            </li>
            <li>In a medium skillet fry the sliced medium onion in 2 tablespoons 
                vegetable oil until golden brown. Add the tomato paste and sauté 
                until aromatic. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>When the chicken is fork tender, discard the onion halves. Turn the 
                chicken pieces one more time (now the meaty part of the chicken will 
                be up) and sprinkle the optional ground saffron powder on the pieces. 
                Use the back of a spoon to rub the saffron on the surface of each 
                piece. This simple added step adds a very rich color to the chicken 
                pieces.
            </li>
            <li>Make the tomato sauce in the same skillet by mixing in the prepared 
                fried onion and tomato paste with the broth. Add 2 tablespoons fresh 
                squeezed lemon juice and 1 tablespoon zereshk to the sauce. Bring it 
                to a boil over medium heat and then reduce the heat to medium low, 
                cover the skillet and cook for 15-20 minutes, then turn the chicken 
                pieces and cook for another 15-20 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>At the end of this cooking time the chicken should easily come apart 
                with a fork. The sauce will be reduced and a glistening oil will 
                rise to the top, or as we say in Farsi, “ja biofteh” which roughly 
                means “to settle.” If there is too much sauce left in the skillet, 
                remove the lid and cook for a few more minutes until it is reduced.
            </li>
            <li><strong>To make the zereshk/fried onion mix:</strong> In the same 
                skillet that you've fried the diced onion, add ⅓ cup barberries 
                and a pinch of optional saffron and saute over low for couple of 
                minutes until the zereshk plumps up. Zereshk burns very quickly so 
                keep the temperature very low.
            </li>
            <li><strong>For the layered presentation of Zereshk Polo:</strong> 
                Use a large spatula to transfer ⅓ of the steamed Aromatic rice 
                to the serving platter, top with ⅓ of the barberry/fried onion 
                mixture and continue layering and finish the top with the remaining 
                zereshk/fried onion. Garnish with sliced almonds and/or pistachios.
            </li>
            <li>Serve the chicken on a separate platter.
            </li>
        </ol>
